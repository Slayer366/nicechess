Chess engines
-------------

Chess engines can be added with the -ce option.

Faile chess engine
------------------

Faile 1.4.4 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/faile/)
does not accept "depth" command so it needs to be
patched in order to be used with NiceChess.

$ PATCHFILE=$(pwd)/faile_1.4.4_depth.patch
$ mkdir /tmp/faile
$ cd /tmp/faile
$ wget -O faile_1_4_4.tar.gz https://sourceforge.net/projects/faile/files/faile/1.4.4/faile_1_4_4.tar.gz/download
$ tar -xzf faile_1_4_4.tar.gz
$ patch -p1 < $PATCHFILE
$ make -f makefile.gcc FLAGS=-DANSI

Gnuchess chess engine
---------------------

Gnuchess 6.2.9 (https://www.gnu.org/software/chess/)
uses too much cpu even in easy, disabled pondering mode,
but it can be fixed.

$ PATCHFILE=$(pwd)/gnuchess_6.2.9_sleep.patch
$ cd $HOME
$ yumdownloader --source gnuchess
(root)$ yum-builddep gnuchess-6.2.9-3.fc36.src.rpm
$ rpmbuild -rp gnuchess-6.2.9-3.fc36.src.rpm
$ cd $HOME/rpmbuild/BUILD/gnuchess-6.2.9
$ patch -p1 < $PATCHFILE
$ ./configure
$ make
